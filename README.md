**TODO:** The `textsize` in the program is deprecated and to be replaced by `textbbox` or `textlength`.

The fonts (tamil) can be replaced in `fonts/` folder and has to be called in the program.

Uncomment `sentance` to place the text inside the program itself. Else, it can be placed in the `sample.txt` file.

The background color can be replaced by issuing RGB values in `color` in line 16.
