It takes three hundred years of prayers to have the chance to cross a river with someone in the same boat. That's what the saying means. There's a reason for every relationship. Husband and wife, parents and children, friends and enemies, strangers you bump into in the street! It takes three thousand years of prayers to place your head side by side with your loved one's on the pillow. For father and daughter? A thousand years, maybe.
