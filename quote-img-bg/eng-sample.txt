There's a reason for every relationship. Husband and wife, parents and children, friends and enemies, strangers you bump into in the street... It takes three thousand years of prayers to place your head side by side with your loved one's on the pillow. For father and daughter? A thousand years, maybe.
Yiyun Li (A Thousand Years of Good Prayers)
